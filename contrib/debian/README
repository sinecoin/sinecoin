This directory contains files used to package sinecoind/sinecoin-qt
for Debian-based Linux systems.

If you compile sinecoind/sinecoin-qt yourself, there are some
useful files here:

sinecoin: URI support
--------------------

sinecoin-qt.desktop  (Gnome / Open Desktop)
To install:
  sudo desktop-file-install sinecoin-qt.desktop
  sudo update-desktop-database

If you build yourself, you will either need to modify the paths in
the .desktop file or copy or symlink your sinecoin-qt binary to /usr/bin
and the ../../share/pixmaps/sinecoin128.png to /usr/share/pixmaps

sinecoin-qt.protocol (KDE)
